18 months later Technical-13 (https://github.com/Technical-13) picked up maintaing the plugin and continued to do so until August 2020.

In April 2021, Duriel (https://github.com/Duriel908), started to maintain the plugin.

In March 2025, Fanchen (https://github.com/fanch3n) took over as maintainer.
