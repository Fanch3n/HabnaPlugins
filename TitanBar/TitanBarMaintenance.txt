All files are encoded in UTF-8.
Some characters are represented by their codes: https://www.utf8-chartable.de/
You can find commonly used codes in the "code.txt" file.
They were used because UTF-8 support was spotty in some editors. They should not be needed anymore.
Make sure you always save files in UTF-8.

Adding a new reputation faction:
- Add the faction text names to the 'de', 'en', and 'fr' localization files (Important: Excatly as they are written in the game, otherwise it won't work)
-- Search for "All reputation names" and add the new name to the end of the existing list
- Add faction in 'Factions.lua'

Add a new currency:
- Add  text names to the 'de', 'en', and 'fr' localization files
-- Search for "Wallet Currency Controls" and add the new currency to the end of the existing list
-- For the names: You need two for each currency.
--- The first one starts with an "M" and can be the name of the currency (without spaces or special characters)
--- The second can be the name of the currency (without spaces or special characters) and then an "h".
--- Important: The name (value) behind the first text name has to be exactly the name in the game (and most of the times singular). Otherwise it won't work.

- Add currency in 'main.lua'
-- Search for "PlayerAlign == 1" and add the item to the MenuItem array. The position in that array defines the order in which the currencies are listed.
-- Add the currency to the CurrencyLangMap

- Add currency in Currencies.lua


To add a new control (from Technical_13):
- Add  text names to the 'de', 'en', and 'fr' localization files

- Add control in 'settings.lua'
- Add control in 'frmOptions.lua'
- Add control in 'background.lua'
- Add control shell command in 'main.lua'
- Add control file in control directory


HelloWorld-Plugin
I needed the icons for some of the new currencies and after much frustration I found a way to get them with a second plugin (creatively named the "HelloWorld-Plugin").
The HelloWorld-Plugin lists all currencies with their icon-/image-number that you have in your wallet.
1. Open the following path: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\
2. Create a new folder with the name "Duriel"
3. Open that folder. The complete path should be: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\Duriel
4. Create a file with the name "HelloWorld.plugin"
5. Create a folder with the name "HelloWorld"
6. Open that folder. The complete path should be: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\Duriel\HelloWorld
7. Create a file with the name "main.lua"
8. Copy the following code into the "HelloWorld.plugin" file. Then save the file.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Plugin>
 <Information>
  <Name>HelloWorld</Name>
  <Author>Duriel</Author>
  <Version>1.00</Version>
 </Information>
 <Package>Duriel.HelloWorld.Main</Package>
 <Configuration Apartment="HelloWorld" />
</Plugin>
9. Copy the following code into the "main.lua" file. Then save the file.
import "Turbine.UI";
import "Turbine.UI.Lotro";
import "Turbine"
import "Turbine.Gameplay"

function print(text) Turbine.Shell.WriteLine("<rgb=#00FFFF>HW:</rgb> "..text) end

Player=Turbine.Gameplay.LocalPlayer:GetInstance();
PlayerWallet = Player:GetWallet();
PlayerWalletSize = PlayerWallet:GetSize();
for i = 1, PlayerWalletSize do
	CurItem = PlayerWallet:GetItem(i);
	CurName = CurItem:GetName();
	CurImage = CurItem:GetImage();
	--print(i .. "=" .. CurName)
	--print(i .. "=" .. CurImage)
	print(CurName .. " has image number " .. CurImage)
end
10. Login to Lotro
11. In the chat window type "/plugins list" (for German and French, scroll down to plugin commands). The HelloWorld-Plugin should be listed. If that is not the case, type "/plugins refresh" and then again "/plugins list"
	The plugins are listed in the "Standard" channel.
12. Type "/plugins load HelloWorld". You get a list with all currencies you have and the corresponding image number.
13. Find the currency, which you want to add, and copy / make a note of the number.
14. Open a hex converter of your choice (I use https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html)
15. Paste the number in the decimal field and convert it to hex.
16. Add the hex number to the item in "Currencies.lua"
17. Unload the HelloWorld-Plugin if you don't need it. Type "/plugins unload HelloWorld".

Plugin commands:
I found out the hard way that the commands you use to load and unload plugins depend on the language of the client. So here are some commands with the translations.
EN: "/plugins load <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule laden <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins charger <PluginName>"
EN: "/plugins unload <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule entfernen <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins vider <PluginName>"
EN: "/plugins list <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule liste <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins liste <PluginName>"
EN: "/plugins refresh <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule aktualisieren <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins actualiser <PluginName>"
